At Maxwell Cleaning Services we provide professional **carpet cleaning**.

We follow a deep and thorough encapsulation carpet cleaning process. Encapsulation carpet cleaning is an interim carpet maintenance method. This method is designed for commercial maintenance only. In this process, the encapsulating chemical is sprayed onto and then brushed into the carpet using a cylindrical or rotary brush machine. The encapsulation chemistry surrounds each soil particle and crystallizes it so it canâ€™t attract other soils. The encapsulated soil particles release from the carpet fiber and are removed by normal vacuuming. Since this is a low-moisture system, carpets can be put back into use promptly. 

Let us eliminate those tough stains and dirt from your carpet.

Benefits to having your carepts cleaned professionally:

*   Improves air quality
*   Eliminates trapped pollutants
*   Extend the life of your carpet
*   Reduces wear and tear in high-traffic areas
